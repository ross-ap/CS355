\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical layer is the lowest level:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understanding that the physical properties of various transition mediums define the proctocls we use
        \item Bit by bit encoding of information into physical signal
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ethernet (copper) cables: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encoded as pulses of electricity 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fiber cables:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encoded as pulses of light
    \end{itemize}
    \item Different physical properties so they may have different protocols
    \item Cabled connections
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DLL protocol = 802.3 Ethernet
        \item Point to point connections (exactly two devices)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Fiber
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Full enclosed glass tubes with mirrored shielding
                \item Photons bounce along the cable until it reaches a detecor 
                \item Needs to be as straight as possible
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Copper / Twisted Pair
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Pair needed to complete the circuit
                \item Two electrical magnetic field generated positive and negatively charged respectively
                \item Field is powerful enough to corrupt data
                \item Electomagnetic inteference cancel each other out if they are close enough hence twisted 
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Wireless connections
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DLL protocol = 802.11 WiFi
        \item Non-directional 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All wireless devices go in every direction
            \item Only matters if the device is within the range
            \item Everyone in the recipient range of the device recieves the data
        \end{itemize}
        \item Encryption by default
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Encryption by default has speed cost
        \end{itemize}
        \item Encoded as radiowaves
    \end{itemize}
    \item Channel Types
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simplex (unidirectionality)
        \item Duplex (biderectionality)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Full Duplex (send and receive at the same time)
            \item Half Duplex (send or receive at any time only one receiver)
        \end{itemize}
        \item All cables can full duplex only restriction is cost
        \item All wireless operate at half duplex
        \item Modern devices operate at half duplex but extremely highspeed
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Operates on the scale of picoseconds
        \end{itemize}
        \item Feels like full duplex 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hardware
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each layer has a specific hardware devices
        \item Network Hub (Physical Layer, Historical)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Solve the limitation of the cable
            \item Central hub that ideally connects all devices
            \item Act as an n-dimensional cables
            \item No CPU or memory, just a bunch of logic gates (reducing cost)
            \item Duplicates signal and sends the signal to all ports
            \item Problem arises when two or more devices send at the same time data easily corrupted
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This is called a collision domain
                \item If there is more than one sender none of the messages get through
            \end{itemize}
            \item Cannot update the hub so you have to update all the devices connected
            \item Carrier Sense Multiple Access
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Solves collission domain problem by sharing the network
                \begin{lstlisting}
                    function CSMA(message){
                        while(receiving){
                            wait();
                        }
                        send(message);
                    }
                \end{lstlisting}
                \item Downgrades connection to half duplex 
                \item Limitation is assuming everyone upgrading at the same time
                \item Devices with CSMA and devices with no CSMA do not play well together
                \item Device without CSMA can still corrupt transmitted data

            \end{itemize}
            \item CSMA With Collision Dection
            \begin{lstlisting}
                function CSMACD (message){
                    for(i = 0; i < message.length; i++){
                        while(receiving){
                            wait();;
                        }
                        send(messaage[i]);
                    }
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Network Switch
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
        \end{itemize}
